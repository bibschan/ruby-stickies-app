# Welcome to Sticky Notes with Ruby 

This application is a Create/Read/Update/Delete app and implemented to visually resemble sticky notes. This project is part of a Youtube free course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP64Wvz13AM&t

What I was able to learn from this project:
- MVC framework concepts (Model: Stores data, View: What the screen renders, Controller: The logic that links the Model and View together)
- Routing URLs 
- Rendering components across several pages to avoid code duplication


# What the final product looks like

# How to run this application

Run ```rails server``` to start your server. Open a new tab on your browswer localhost:3000. No need to re-compile, save your changes and refresh the broswer.
